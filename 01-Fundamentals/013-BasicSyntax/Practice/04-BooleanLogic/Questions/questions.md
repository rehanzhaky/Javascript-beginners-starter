# JavaScript Boolean Logic Practice
Complete the following exercises to practice working with boolean values and logical operators in JavaScript:
1. Create two variables: `hasLicense` and `isInsured`, and assign them boolean values based on whether you have a driver's license and car insurance.
2. Create a variable `canDrive` that is true only if both `hasLicense` and `isInsured` are true.
3. Print the value of `canDrive` to the console.
## Example OutputIf you have a license but don't have insurance, your console output should look like:
```
false
```
If you have both a license and insurance, your console output should look like:
```
true
```
