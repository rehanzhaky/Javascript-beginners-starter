Complete the following exercises to practice JavaScript variable declarations and basic data types:
1. Declare a `const` variable named `favoriteColor` and assign it your favorite color as a string.
2. Declare a `let` variable named `age` and assign it your age as a number.
3. Declare a `let` variable named `isStudent` and assign it a boolean value based on whether you are currently a student.
4. Print the values of all three variables to the console.
