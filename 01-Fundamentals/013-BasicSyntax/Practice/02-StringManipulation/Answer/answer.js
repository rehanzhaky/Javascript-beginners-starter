// Create two variables: `firstName` and `lastName`, and assign them your first and last names as strings.
let firstName = "Raihan";
let lastName = "Zhaki";

// Use string concatenation to create a `fullName` variable that combines your first and last names with a space in between.
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

// Use a template literal to create a `greeting` message that includes your full name.
let greeting = `Hello, my name is ${fullName}!`
