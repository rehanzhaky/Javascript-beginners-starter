# JavaScript String Operations Practice
Complete the following exercises to practice working with strings in JavaScript:
1. Create two variables: `firstName` and `lastName`, and assign them your first and last names as strings.
2. Use string concatenation to create a `fullName` variable that combines your first and last names with a space in between.
3. Use a template literal to create a `greeting` message that includes your full name.
4. Print the greeting message to the console.
## Example Output If your name is John Doe, your console output should look like:
```
Hello, my name is John Doe!
```
